# SAVE THE KING 

SAVE THE KING is my 1st-semester project.
This is a challenging game that requires strategy and thinking. 
Game Goal - take the KING to the THRONE. 
The player can switch between 4 different characters, and Each one has its own unique abilities. 
Each level contains obstacles and Gifts, that may help the player or not..
There are 3 different levels, each has a time limitation to finish the level.
Also every time a player starts a new game, he receives 3 "lives". 
If all 3 "lives" spend, the game is over.
